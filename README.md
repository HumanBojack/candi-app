# Candidatures' application for Simplon

## The project
This project is **a fork of [another project](https://github.com/charles-42/candi-app)** in order to add new functionnalities. The idea was to have a little web-app used **to add our job candidacies** in order for the admins to **track them** easily and quickly.

## The mockup
We used **Figma** in order to make the foundation of what the Ui/Ux would look and feel like. Here is [the mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/5D2N5B4WN3YxEyJRav7CbS/Candidat_suivi?node-id=0%3A1).

## Database
![Our database](https://i.imgur.com/ixFJUXl.png)
We made the choice to have our website, **and it's database** revolve around the users' candidacies.

Every company and location has **it's own table** in order to sort the candidacies easily if we want to.
